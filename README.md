# A serverless project made with ReactJS for Web, Flutter for Mobile and Firestore as backend
This project had a purpose to make me put my hands on code, to use the knowledge I got studying Flutter then I created the manager app wich is responsible to seed information to the mobile app using React. It's not a real project, and has a lot of features to be added, but like I said, it was just made to put hands on. <br/>
